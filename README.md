Work That Needs to be Done:
- Trouble shooting the portal frames as they currently work in editor view but not in VR 
- Adding the book to give the players the onboarding of how to use the picture frames
- Creating the environments for both what will be inside our frames when the player looks in as well as the cozy environment of the hub area

Ladder Goals
- Window with buttons below that will change the outside's weather
- Adding more enviorments and more picture frames for players to interact with
